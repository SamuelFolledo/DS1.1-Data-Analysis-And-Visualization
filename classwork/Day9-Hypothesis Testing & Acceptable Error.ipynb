    "- When the samples of our numerical array are Normal with an arbitrary mean and std\n",

    "- In above example, we could not easily obtain the percentage from a PDF, although it is possible. ",

    "\t4.\tRepeat step three, increasing the threshold by one, until you go through step three where threshold is equail to the maximum value in the array"
